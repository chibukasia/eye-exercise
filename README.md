# Eye Exercise

## Description

This project creates a simple animation of two eyes following the movement of the mouse cursor on the screen. The eyes are represented by two div elements that track the mouse position and move accordingly.

## How to Run

To run this project on your machine:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Roadmap of Future Improvements

In the future, I plan to implement the following improvements:
- Add more realistic eye movement, such as blinking or dilating.
- Enhance the visual appearance with additional elements, such as eyelids or facial features.
- Implement user controls to customize the behavior of the eyes, such as speed or responsiveness.
